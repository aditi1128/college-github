It's the weekend of FOSDEM and we are more excited than ever for an in-person Open Source Design devroom after 3 years! Join us in Brussels for an afternoon of design talks, chit chat and drinks! Here's everything you need to know about getting to the Open Source Design devroom at FOSDEM.

## Where is it?

**In person:** FOSDEM will take place at the [Université Libre de Bruxelles](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/13699100) in Brusells, Belgium. The ULB website has lots of info about [how to get there](https://www.ulb.be/en/solbosch/directions#deplacements). The Open Source Design devroom will take place in room UB4.132 (building U, entrance B, floor 4, room 132). This [map of the campus](https://www.ulb.be/en/maps-directions/solbosch) could be helpful.

**Remote:** All FOSDEM talks are being livestreamed, so you can watch them from anywhere in the world! Find the Open Source Design devroom on the [FOSDEM livestream page](https://fosdem.org/2023/live/). You can also ask questions during the Q&A sessions from there!

There is also a [chat](https://chat.fosdem.org/) for FOSDEM where you can hang out with other remote attendees and grab a virtual drink, and of course, you can always find us on Mastodon [@opensourcedesign@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@opensourcedesign), Twitter [@opensrcdesign](https://twitter.com/opensrcdesign), and [Discourse](https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net).

## When do I need to be there?

The talks in the Open Source Design devroom will be presented on the second half of Sunday from 13:00 CET to 17:00 CET. Check the [schedule](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/open_source_design/) to make sure you don't miss your favourite talk!

Besides the actual talks, we are also going to be hanging out in main cafeteria for some chitchat on Saturday 04.02 from 10:00 to 12:00 CET like we mentioned on our [forum post](https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net/t/fosdem-2023-organisation/3224/14). We will take over a table and there will be some signs so that you can spot us.

## How can I get involved?

We're glad you asked! You can help in many ways, including managing the crowd and making sure the room is not exceeding capacity, covering the event on social media, moderating and helping out in the chat rooms, and anything else! Put your name and how and when you'd like to volunteer in our [volunteers list](https://cloud.opensourcedesign.net/s/d9jsa3EDJWAKKHG).

## Any questions?

Check out the [FOSDEM FAQ](https://fosdem.org/2023/faq/) if you have any questions about attending or send a message on the [Open Source Design Discourse forum](https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net) and we will help you out.

Excited to see you there!
