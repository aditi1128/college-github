# Open Source Design milestones over the years

Open Source Design has acheived many things in the 5+ years the community has been running. From running regular FOSDEM Dev rooms for open source design topics to holding local meet-ups and gaining over 600 community members.
The community has changed and evolved over the years and its great to look back on the achievements of Open Source Design, so in response to an [issue created in 2016](https://github.com/opensourcedesign/opensourcedesign.github.io/issues/63) I began to catalogue a few of the key milestones of open source design.
There will be events and occurences I've missed but here's a round up of the last 6 years.
