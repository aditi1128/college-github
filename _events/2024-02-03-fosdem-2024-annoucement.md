The weekend of FOSDEM 2024 has been annouced and we are excited for another in-person Open Source Design devroom! Join us in Brussels for design talks, discussion and fun! Here's everything you need to know about getting to the Open Source Design devroom at FOSDEM.
The Open Source Design community groups welcomes and encourages folks from both design and non-design backgrounds to submit talks related to design to the dev room and attend the talks in the devroom. If you'd like a buddy or someone to chat to before joining us you can check out our [discourse forum](https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net).

## Where is it?

**In person:** FOSDEM 2024 will take place at the [Université Libre de Bruxelles](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/13699100) in Brusells, Belgium. The ULB website has lots of info about [how to get there](https://www.ulb.be/en/solbosch/directions#deplacements). The Open Source Design devroom will take place in room (Pending info). This [map of the campus](https://www.ulb.be/en/maps-directions/solbosch) could be helpful.

**Remote:** All FOSDEM talks are being livestreamed, so you can watch them from anywhere in the world! Find the Open Source Design devroom on the [FOSDEM livestream page](https://fosdem.org/2024/live/). You can also ask questions during the Q&A sessions from there!

There is also a [chat](https://chat.fosdem.org/) for FOSDEM where you can hang out with other remote attendees and grab a virtual drink, and of course, you can always find us on Mastodon [@opensourcedesign@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@opensourcedesign), Twitter [@opensrcdesign](https://twitter.com/opensrcdesign), and [Discourse](https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net).

## When do I need to be there?

The Open Source Design FOSDEM Devroom team is waiting to hear from the conference whether we have a room for saturday, sunday or both days. Keep an eye on the [schedule](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/open-source-design/) to make sure you don't miss your favourite talk once published!

Besides the actual talks, we are also going to be hanging out in main cafeteria for some chitchat, day and time TBC.

## How do I get involved?

We're glad you asked! You can help in many ways, including managing the crowd and making sure the room is not exceeding capacity, covering the event on social media, moderating and helping out in the chat rooms, and anything else! Put your name and how and when you'd like to volunteer in our [volunteers list](https://cloud.opensourcedesign.net/s/d9jsa3EDJWAKKHG).

Our call for talks will open soon so keep an eye out!

## Any questions?
